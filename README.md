# **RCQoEA-360VR-Dataset: Real-time, Continuous QoE scores for HMD-based 360Â° VR (RCQoEA 360VR) Dataset**

The RCQoEA-360VR dataset is a novel multi-modal dataset designed for continuous QoE evaluation in virtual reality (VR) environments. The dataset contains continuous QoE annotations, synchronised physiological signals (ECG and GSR), behavioural data (eye and head movements) and post-viewing QoE ratings gathered through a within-VR interface from 32 participants. RCQoEA-360VR addresses a critical gap in existing public datasets by providing a fine-grained, synchronised multimodal data for immersive QoE analysis, as well as behavioural modelling, adaptive streaming, and implicit perceptual analysis.

## **Dataset Structure**

The RCQoEA-360VR folder contains the following six subfolders

    1.Behavioral_Data
    2.Physiological_Data
    3.QoE_Annotation_Data
    4.Questionnaires
    5.Scripts
    6.Stimuli

The following is a detailed description of each sub-file:

###1.Behavioral_Data

	contains the raw and processed ECG data captured from Polar H10 chest belt for each participant
- GSR
	contains the raw and processed GSR data captured from Shimmer GSR device for each participant

###3.QoE_Annotation_Data

- Continuous_QoE_Score
	contains the continuous QoE annotation data captured from the touch-pad for each participant
- Post_Video_QoE_Score
	contains the post-video QoE scores captured using within-VR interface for each participant

###4.Questionnaires

- contains questionnaire data (IPQ, SSQ, NASA TLX and participant information) for each participant

###5.Scripts
