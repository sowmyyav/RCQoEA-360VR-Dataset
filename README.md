RCQoEA-360VR-Dataset: Real-time, Continuous QoE scores for HMD-based 360Â° VR (RCQoEA 360VR) Dataset

RCQoEA_Dataset_TUS folder is organized into two main subfolders:

This folder contains the data of 32 selected participants with complete physiology data suitable for Quality of Experience (QoE) analysis. However, among these participants, 4 individuals have missing eye movement (EM) data.

Each participant ID (PID) folder within these subfolders contains an "RCQoEA data" directory, which further includes time-segmented ECG and GSR data for each trial, along with EM, head movement (HM), PostQuestion and RCQoE score files.
Additionally, complete ECG data for the entire session is provided in CSV and XDF formats, while GSR data for each participant's entire session is available in CSV format.

Sampling Frequency:

ECG data was captured using PolarH10 at a sampling frequency of 130Hz, saved as .xdf files, and converted to CSV format. Shimmer GSR units were utilized to capture GSR and PPG data at the same sampling frequency of 130Hz.
